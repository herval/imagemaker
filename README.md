The app should be self-explanatory

## How We Used Supabase

### Data Storage
We used Supabase db to store user data, image metadata, and other application-related data. The database schema includes tables for users, images, and various other entities to support the application's features.

### Authentication
We used Supabase Auth to handle user authentication and authorization. We also implemented role-based access control to ensure that users can only access the resources they are allowed to.

### Storage
Supabase Storage was used to manage image files and other assets. This allowed us to securely store and serve images, making it easy for users to upload and share their creations with others.

### Additional Information for Judges

We built Clio Image Maker with the goal of providing an easy-to-use platform for artists and creators to express their creativity and collaborate with others. Throughout the development process, we focused on creating an intuitive user interface, optimizing performance, and ensuring data security. We hope our project showcases the power and flexibility of Supabase as a backend service and inspires others to build innovative applications using Supabase.
